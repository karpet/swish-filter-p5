=head1 NAME

SWISH::Filters::ppt2txt - convert PowerPoint docs to text using catppt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a plug-in module that uses the C<catppt> program to convert MS PowerPoint documents
to text for indexing by Swish-e.  C<catppt> is part of the C<catdoc> package
and can be downloaded from:

    http://www.45.free.net/~vitus/software/catdoc/

The program C<catppt> must be installed and in your PATH.

=head1 BUGS

This filter does not specify input or output character encodings.

A minor optimization during spidering (i.e. when docs are in memory instead of on disk)
would be to use open2() call to let catdoc read from stdin instead of from a file.
